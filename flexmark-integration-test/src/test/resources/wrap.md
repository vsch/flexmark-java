idea-multimarkdown
==================
       
idea-multimarkdown plugin provides **[Markdown] language support for [IntelliJ IDEA], 
[RubyMine], [PhpStorm], [WebStorm], [PyCharm], [AppCode], [Android Studio], [CLion] and 
[DataGrip].** 

**You can download it on the [JetBrains plugin page].**

The aim of this plugin is to be able to generate a preview that it is as close as possible to 
how the page will look on GitHub but do it with more IntelliJ environment intelligence to make 
editing and maintaining markdown documents easier. Developing with pleasure is only half the 
job. Real projects need to be documented. This plugin wants to extend the pleasure principle to 
the inevitable documentation part of the project. 

GitHub may recognize variants of Markdown syntax that this plugin will not and vice versa. This 
is due to the parser differences and the fact that GitHub has a few syntax modifications that 
conflict with original Markdown spec. This plugin uses [pegdown] library by [sirthias] with a 
few extensions added to make the rendering of GFM more faithful. 

**For any communications requiring a reply** please use the [GitHub Issues page] for this plugin. There is no ability to 
reply to comments left on the [JetBrains plugin comment and rate page]. 

**[Wiki] added** with instructions on how to include your [GitHub wiki  in IntelliJ IDE] so you 
can work on the wiki in the IDE and use the plugin for syntax highlighting,preview, link 
completions and validation. This makes adding images and manipulating the wiki a lot easier. 

#### Two tier model of the plugin

1. Previewing and syntax highlighting functionality is available in the Basic open source 
   edition. Intended for mostly previewing markdown documents. Wiki link refactoring and 
   completions are also available in the basic edition to ease the task of wiki maintenance. 

2. Advanced features used for creating and maintaining markdown documents such as split editor, refactoring, find 
   usages, validation, auto formatting and HTML page customizations are only available in the Enhanced licensed version. 
   30-day free trial licenses are available from [idea-multimarkdown] page on my website. 
                                                    
![Capabilities](/assets/images/capabilities.png)

### Updating of the source  

There was much code churn in the enhanced version and I have not had time to merge them into the open source version. 
Initially when most of the differences were limited to a few files it easy to keep them separated and sync the rest. 
Now, with major preferences and settings re-work, directory layout changes and new features, the differences have spread 
out where keeping them in sync is a major effort. I started factoring out the enhanced only changes to separate files so 
that future synchronization of the two branches can be less time consuming. 

I am part way through the task but the formatting wound up being much more intricate than I imagined and it is not 
leaving me much time to make updates to latest version. I will address it as soon as I have the formatting functionality 
complete. 

Latest Developments: Version 1.4.5
----------------------------------

For a full list see the [Version Notes]

#### Format and Wrap on Edit

- As you type formatting for setext header marker equalization and matching atx trailing markers 
- Smart bold/italic doubling 
- Syntax highlight for markdown hard break, two spaces before at the end 
  of line that has a continuation. 

##### new Enhanced Edition features  

* Editor Code Style for Markdown, for now only the format on edit options are implemented 
* Wrap on typing for text blocks, footnotes, list items, definitions with options to align continuation lines: 
    - to first line's text (defaults)
    - no indent
    - indent 1 level
    - indent 2 levels
* Format as you type for tables with options for:
    - align column widths
    - align column text to reflect column's actual alignment
    - add/remove opening and closing pipes on each row
    - add/remove padding spaces around pipes and this is a test
    - add/remove/leave left alignment column header marker
    
    Here is what it looks like with all options enabled: 

    ![Table Auto Format](/assets/images/TableAutoFormat.gif)

Latest Developments: Version 1.4.4
----------------------------------

#### Bug Fix Release

- Fix: #153, #154, #155
- Fix: settings forms not always disposed
- Change: References that have reference images referencing them, will have link address completion defaulting to image 
  files 

Latest Developments: Version 1.4.3
----------------------------------

#### Minor Improvements & Bug Fixes

- GitHub issue # completions added in plain text and `issues/` link 
- Option to view GitHub page in preview if the document was committed and has not been modified. 
- Added more elements to code folding and added configuration for 
  collapse by default in settings/preferences 
- Improved link completions and added changing of completion addressing format by repeated invocations of the completion 
  action 

#### File Move Refactoring added in 1.4.2

* Implemented refactoring of links contained in the file being moved. Link format is preserved, wiki links will be 
  changed to explicit links if the file is moved out of the wiki directory. 
* **To Keep your links in sync** use rename refactoring for: 
    * link addresses
    * anchor references and header text
    * references and reference links
* Intentions implemented to replace annotator quick fixes. Now intentions can be individually disabled and no more weak 
  warning highlighting just to get the quick fix to show up. 
                     
### Still Great GitHub Rendering Resemblance for your preview pleasure

Plugins that are a great compliment to idea-multimarkdown
---------------------------------------------------------

[Pipe Table Formatter] A plugin that is great for formatting markdown tables. I use to pretty up the tables in markdown 
and find it a great compliment to idea-multimarkdown. 

[.gitignore] to add .gitignore file brains to the IDE and allows idea-multimarkdown to show files and links to files 
that will only resolve locally because they are not under git vcs. 
                                                        
The Background
--------------

It all started with a desire to see Markdown files in PhpStorm IDE as they would look on GitHub. I was already using 
[nicoulaj/idea-markdown plugin] but found its preview was more like [Craig's List] than [GitHub]. It did not appear to 
have been recently updated, so I decided to fork it and modify the style sheet it uses. How hard could that be? 

I found out quickly that there was more to it than meets the eye. Rendering is done by Java not a browser, the parser is 
HTML 3.1 and not all features are implemented. Additionally, the Table extension did not work in the version of 
`pegdown` used by the plugin. I needed that because maintaining HTML tables is a pain. So I upgraded the plugin to use 
the latest `pegdown`, `parboiled` and fixed a few bugs. Since I was already in the code, I might as well add a few more 
desired features like user editable style sheet, fix a few more bugs, add updates to preview so that I could split the 
editor pane and edit in one while seeing the preview in the other. 

Then I encountered some bugs in parsing of compound nested lists in `pegdown` and had to dive into its source to fix 
them. Having done that and gotten familiar with it, I decided to add a new extension. Finally, to help me with debugging 
and generating test expectations for `pegdown`, I had to have the HTML Text tab to display the generated HTML. 

It has been a fun trip down the rabbit hole of IntelliJ IDEA plugin development that started with a simple desire for a 
Markdown preview that looked like GitHub's.

Forking                  
-------

This plugin is using a modified version of [sirthias], I post my PR's but there is always a delay in both generating 
them and for them to be merged. 

I added a few changes and extensions to the parser. For now I am using my forked copy until the official version has all 
the features. 

The pegdown source used in this plugin can be found [vsch/pegdown].

idea-multimarkdown
==================
       
idea-multimarkdown plugin provides **[Markdown] language support for 
[IntelliJ IDEA], [RubyMine], [PhpStorm], [WebStorm], [PyCharm], 
[AppCode], [Android Studio], [CLion] and [DataGrip].** 

**You can download it on the [JetBrains plugin page].**

The aim of this plugin is to be able to generate a preview that it is as 
close as possible to how the page will look on GitHub but do it with 
more IntelliJ environment intelligence to make editing and maintaining 
markdown documents easier. Developing with pleasure is only half the 
job. Real projects need to be documented. This plugin wants to extend 
the pleasure principle to the inevitable documentation part of the 
project. 

GitHub may recognize variants of Markdown syntax that this plugin will 
not and vice versa. This is due to the parser differences and the fact 
that GitHub has a few syntax modifications that conflict with original 
Markdown spec. This plugin uses [pegdown] library by [sirthias] with a 
few extensions added to make the rendering of GFM more faithful. 

**For any communications requiring a reply** please use the   
[GitHub Issues page] for this plugin. There is no ability to reply to 
comments left on the [JetBrains plugin comment and rate page]. 

**[Wiki] added** with instructions on how to include your [GitHub wiki 
in IntelliJ IDE] so you can work on the wiki in the IDE and use the 
plugin for syntax highlighting,preview, link completions and validation. 
This makes adding images and manipulating the wiki a lot easier. 

#### Two tier model of the plugin

1. Previewing and syntax highlighting functionality is available in the 
   Basic open source edition. Intended for mostly previewing markdown 
   documents. Wiki link refactoring and completions are also available 
   in the basic edition to ease the task of wiki maintenance. 

2. Advanced features used for creating and maintaining markdown 
   documents such as split editor, refactoring, find usages, validation, 
   auto formatting and HTML page customizations are only available in 
   the Enhanced licensed version. 30-day free trial licenses are 
   available from [idea-multimarkdown] page on my website. 
                                                    
![Capabilities](/assets/images/capabilities.png)

### Updating of the source  

There was much code churn in the enhanced version and I have not had 
time to merge them into the open source version. Initially when most of 
the differences were limited to a few files it easy to keep them 
separated and sync the rest. Now, with major preferences and settings 
re-work, directory layout changes and new features, the differences have 
spread out where keeping them in sync is a major effort. I started 
factoring out the enhanced only changes to separate files so that future 
synchronization of the two branches can be less time consuming. 

I am part way through the task but the formatting wound up being much 
more intricate than I imagined and it is not leaving me much time to 
make updates to latest version. I will address it as soon as I have the 
formatting functionality complete. 

Latest Developments: Version 1.4.5
----------------------------------

For a full list see the [Version Notes]

#### Format and Wrap on Edit

- As you type formatting for setext header marker equalization and 
  matching atx trailing markers 
- Smart bold/italic doubling 
- Syntax highlight for markdown hard break, two spaces before at the end 
  of line that has a continuation. 

##### new Enhanced Edition features  

* Editor Code Style for Markdown, for now only the format on edit 
  options are implemented 
* Wrap on typing for text blocks, footnotes, list items, definitions 
  with options to align continuation lines: 
    - to first line's text (default)
    - no indent
    - indent 1 level
    - indent 2 levels
* Format as you type for tables with options for:
    - align column widths
    - align column text to reflect column's actual alignment
    - add/remove opening and closing pipes on each row
    - add/remove padding spaces around pipes
    - add/remove/leave left alignment column header marker
    
    Here is what it looks like with all options enabled: 

    ![Table Auto Format](/assets/images/TableAutoFormat.gif)

Latest Developments: Version 1.4.4
----------------------------------

#### Bug Fix Release

- Fix: #153, #154, #155
- Fix: settings forms not always disposed
- Change: References that have reference images referencing them, will 
  have link address completion defaulting to image files 

Latest Developments: Version 1.4.3
----------------------------------

#### Minor Improvements & Bug Fixes

- GitHub issue # completions added in plain text and `issues/` link 
- Option to view GitHub page in preview if the document was committed 
  and has not been modified. 
- Added more elements to code folding and added configuration for 
  collapse by default in settings/preferences 
- Improved link completions and added changing of completion addressing 
  format by repeated invocations of the completion action 

#### File Move Refactoring added in 1.4.2

* Implemented refactoring of links contained in the file being moved. 
  Link format is preserved, wiki links will be changed to explicit links 
  if the file is moved out of the wiki directory. 
* **To Keep your links in sync** use rename refactoring for: 
    * link addresses
    * anchor references and header text
    * references and reference links
* Intentions implemented to replace annotator quick fixes. Now 
  intentions can be individually disabled and no more weak warning 
  highlighting just to get the quick fix to show up. 
                     
### Still Great GitHub Rendering Resemblance for your preview pleasure

##### One of the images is idea-multimarkdown preview, the other of same file on GitHub:

Plugins that are a great compliment to idea-multimarkdown
---------------------------------------------------------

[Pipe Table Formatter] A plugin that is great for formatting markdown 
tables. I use to pretty up the tables in markdown and find it a great 
compliment to idea-multimarkdown. 

[.gitignore] to add .gitignore file brains to the IDE and allows 
idea-multimarkdown to show files and links to files that will only 
resolve locally because they are not under git vcs. 
                                                        
The Background
--------------

It all started with a desire to see Markdown files in PhpStorm IDE as 
they would look on GitHub. I was already using  
[nicoulaj/idea-markdown plugin] but found its preview was more like  
[Craig's List] than [GitHub]. It did not appear to have been recently 
updated, so I decided to fork it and modify the style sheet it uses. How 
hard could that be? 

I found out quickly that there was more to it than meets the eye. 
Rendering is done by Java not a browser, the parser is HTML 3.1 and not 
all features are implemented. Additionally, the Table extension did not 
work in the version of `pegdown` used by the plugin. I needed that 
because maintaining HTML tables is a pain. So I upgraded the plugin to 
use the latest `pegdown`, `parboiled` and fixed a few bugs. Since I was 
already in the code, I might as well add a few more desired features 
like user editable style sheet, fix a few more bugs, add updates to 
preview so that I could split the editor pane and edit in one while 
seeing the preview in the other. 

Then I encountered some bugs in parsing of compound nested lists in 
`pegdown` and had to dive into its source to fix them. Having done that 
and gotten familiar with it, I decided to add a new extension. Finally, 
to help me with debugging and generating test expectations for 
`pegdown`, I had to have the HTML Text tab to display the generated 
HTML. 

It has been a fun trip down the rabbit hole of IntelliJ IDEA plugin 
development that started with a simple desire for a Markdown preview 
that looked like GitHub's.

Forking
-------

This plugin is using a modified version of [sirthias], I post my PR's 
but there is always a delay in both generating them and for them to be 
merged. 

I added a few changes and extensions to the parser. For now I am using 
my forked copy until the official version has all the features. 

The pegdown source used in this plugin can be found [vsch/pegdown].

idea-multimarkdown
==================
       
idea-multimarkdown plugin provides **[Markdown] language support for 
[IntelliJ IDEA], [RubyMine], [PhpStorm], [WebStorm], [PyCharm], 
[AppCode], [Android Studio], [CLion] and [DataGrip].** 

**You can download it on the [JetBrains plugin page].**

The aim of this plugin is to be able to generate a preview that it is as 
close as possible to how the page will look on GitHub but do it with 
more IntelliJ environment intelligence to make editing and maintaining 
markdown documents easier. Developing with pleasure is only half the 
job. Real projects need to be documented. This plugin wants to extend 
the pleasure principle to the inevitable documentation part of the 
project. 

GitHub may recognize variants of Markdown syntax that this plugin will 
not and vice versa. This is due to the parser differences and the fact 
that GitHub has a few syntax modifications that conflict with original 
Markdown spec. This plugin uses [pegdown] library by [sirthias] with a 
few extensions added to make the rendering of GFM more faithful. 

**For any communications requiring a reply** please use the   
[GitHub Issues page] for this plugin. There is no ability to reply to 
comments left on the [JetBrains plugin comment and rate page]. 

**[Wiki] added** with instructions on how to include your [GitHub wiki 
in IntelliJ IDE] so you can work on the wiki in the IDE and use the 
plugin for syntax highlighting,preview, link completions and validation. 
This makes adding images and manipulating the wiki a lot easier. 

#### Two tier model of the plugin

1. Previewing and syntax highlighting functionality is available in the 
   Basic open source edition. Intended for mostly previewing markdown 
   documents. Wiki link refactoring and completions are also available 
   in the basic edition to ease the task of wiki maintenance. 

2. Advanced features used for creating and maintaining markdown 
   documents such as split editor, refactoring, find usages, validation, 
   auto formatting and HTML page customizations are only available in 
   the Enhanced licensed version. 30-day free trial licenses are 
   available from [idea-multimarkdown] page on my website. 
                                                    
![Capabilities](/assets/images/capabilities.png)

### Updating of the source  

There was much code churn in the enhanced version and I have not had 
time to merge them into the open source version. Initially when most of 
the differences were limited to a few files it easy to keep them 
separated and sync the rest. Now, with major preferences and settings 
re-work, directory layout changes and new features, the differences have 
spread out where keeping them in sync is a major effort. I started 
factoring out the enhanced only changes to separate files so that future 
synchronization of the two branches can be less time consuming. 

I am part way through the task but the formatting wound up being much 
more intricate than I imagined and it is not leaving me much time to 
make updates to latest version. I will address it as soon as I have the 
formatting functionality complete. 

Latest Developments: Version 1.4.5
----------------------------------

For a full list see the [Version Notes]

#### Format and Wrap on Edit

- As you type formatting for setext header marker equalization and 
  matching atx trailing markers 
- Smart bold/italic doubling 
- Syntax highlight for markdown hard break, two spaces before at the end 
  of line that has a continuation. 

##### new Enhanced Edition features  

* Editor Code Style for Markdown, for now only the format on edit 
  options are implemented 
* Wrap on typing for text blocks, footnotes, list items, definitions 
  with options to align continuation lines: 
    - to first line's text (default)
    - no indent
    - indent 1 level
    - indent 2 levels
* Format as you type for tables with options for:
    - align column widths
    - align column text to reflect column's actual alignment
    - add/remove opening and closing pipes on each row
    - add/remove padding spaces around pipes
    - add/remove/leave left alignment column header marker
    
    Here is what it looks like with all options enabled: 

    ![Table Auto Format](/assets/images/TableAutoFormat.gif)

Latest Developments: Version 1.4.4
----------------------------------

#### Bug Fix Release

- Fix: #153, #154, #155
- Fix: settings forms not always disposed
- Change: References that have reference images referencing them, will 
  have link address completion defaulting to image files 

Latest Developments: Version 1.4.3
----------------------------------

#### Minor Improvements & Bug Fixes

- GitHub issue # completions added in plain text and `issues/` link 
- Option to view GitHub page in preview if the document was committed 
  and has not been modified. 
- Added more elements to code folding and added configuration for 
  collapse by default in settings/preferences 
- Improved link completions and added changing of completion addressing 
  format by repeated invocations of the completion action 

#### File Move Refactoring added in 1.4.2

* Implemented refactoring of links contained in the file being moved. 
  Link format is preserved, wiki links will be changed to explicit links 
  if the file is moved out of the wiki directory. 
* **To Keep your links in sync** use rename refactoring for: 
    * link addresses
    * anchor references and header text
    * references and reference links
* Intentions implemented to replace annotator quick fixes. Now 
  intentions can be individually disabled and no more weak warning 
  highlighting just to get the quick fix to show up. 
                     
### Still Great GitHub Rendering Resemblance for your preview pleasure

##### One of the images is idea-multimarkdown preview, the other of same file on GitHub:

Plugins that are a great compliment to idea-multimarkdown
---------------------------------------------------------

[Pipe Table Formatter] A plugin that is great for formatting markdown 
tables. I use to pretty up the tables in markdown and find it a great 
compliment to idea-multimarkdown. 

[.gitignore] to add .gitignore file brains to the IDE and allows 
idea-multimarkdown to show files and links to files that will only 
resolve locally because they are not under git vcs. 
                                                        
The Background
--------------

It all started with a desire to see Markdown files in PhpStorm IDE as 
they would look on GitHub. I was already using  
[nicoulaj/idea-markdown plugin] but found its preview was more like  
[Craig's List] than [GitHub]. It did not appear to have been recently 
updated, so I decided to fork it and modify the style sheet it uses. How 
hard could that be? 

I found out quickly that there was more to it than meets the eye. 
Rendering is done by Java not a browser, the parser is HTML 3.1 and not 
all features are implemented. Additionally, the Table extension did not 
work in the version of `pegdown` used by the plugin. I needed that 
because maintaining HTML tables is a pain. So I upgraded the plugin to 
use the latest `pegdown`, `parboiled` and fixed a few bugs. Since I was 
already in the code, I might as well add a few more desired features 
like user editable style sheet, fix a few more bugs, add updates to 
preview so that I could split the editor pane and edit in one while 
seeing the preview in the other. 

Then I encountered some bugs in parsing of compound nested lists in 
`pegdown` and had to dive into its source to fix them. Having done that 
and gotten familiar with it, I decided to add a new extension. Finally, 
to help me with debugging and generating test expectations for 
`pegdown`, I had to have the HTML Text tab to display the generated 
HTML. 

It has been a fun trip down the rabbit hole of IntelliJ IDEA plugin 
development that started with a simple desire for a Markdown preview 
that looked like GitHub's.

Forking
-------

This plugin is using a modified version of [sirthias], I post my PR's 
but there is always a delay in both generating them and for them to be 
merged. 

I added a few changes and extensions to the parser. For now I am using 
my forked copy until the official version has all the features. 

The pegdown source used in this plugin can be found [vsch/pegdown].

\* This plugin is based on the [nicoulaj/idea-markdown plugin] by

#### Minor Improvements & Bug Fixes

- GitHub issue # completions added in plain text and `issues/` link 
- Option to view GitHub page in preview if the document was committed 
  and has not been modified. 
- Added more elements to code folding and added configuration for 
  collapse by default in settings/preferences 
- Improved link completions and added changing of completion addressing 
  format by repeated invocations of the completion action 

#### File Move Refactoring added in 1.4.2

* Implemented refactoring of links contained in the file being moved. 
  Link format is preserved, wiki links will be changed to explicit links 
  if the file is moved out of the wiki directory. 
* **To Keep your links in sync** use rename refactoring for: 
    * link addresses
    * anchor references and header text
    * references and reference links
* Intentions implemented to replace annotator quick fixes. Now 
  intentions can be individually disabled and no more weak warning 
  highlighting just to get the quick fix to show up. 
                     
### Still Great GitHub Rendering Resemblance for your preview pleasure

Plugins that are a great compliment to idea-multimarkdown
---------------------------------------------------------

[Pipe Table Formatter] A plugin that is great for formatting markdown 
tables. I use to pretty up the tables in markdown and find it a great 
compliment to idea-multimarkdown. 

[.gitignore] to add .gitignore file brains to the IDE and allows 
idea-multimarkdown to show files and links to files that will only 
resolve locally because they are not under git vcs. 
                                                        
The Background
--------------

It all started with a desire to see Markdown files in PhpStorm IDE as 
they would look on GitHub. I was already using  
[nicoulaj/idea-markdown plugin] but found its preview was more like  
[Craig's List] than [GitHub]. It did not appear to have been recently 
updated, so I decided to fork it and modify the style sheet it uses. How 
hard could that be? 

I found out quickly that there was more to it than meets the eye. 
Rendering is done by Java not a browser, the parser is HTML 3.1 and not 
all features are implemented. Additionally, the Table extension did not 
work in the version of `pegdown` used by the plugin. I needed that 
because maintaining HTML tables is a pain. So I upgraded the plugin to 
use the latest `pegdown`, `parboiled` and fixed a few bugs. Since I was 
already in the code, I might as well add a few more desired features 
like user editable style sheet, fix a few more bugs, add updates to 
preview so that I could split the editor pane and edit in one while 
seeing the preview in the other. 

Then I encountered some bugs in parsing of compound nested lists in 
`pegdown` and had to dive into its source to fix them. Having done that 
and gotten familiar with it, I decided to add a new extension. Finally, 
to help me with debugging and generating test expectations for 
`pegdown`, I had to have the HTML Text tab to display the generated 
HTML. 

It has been a fun trip down the rabbit hole of IntelliJ IDEA plugin 
development that started with a simple desire for a Markdown preview 
that looked like GitHub's.

Forking
-------

This plugin is using a modified version of [sirthias], I post my PR's 
but there is always a delay in both generating them and for them to be 
merged. 

I added a few changes and extensions to the parser. For now I am using 
my forked copy until the official version has all the features. 

The pegdown source used in this plugin can be found [vsch/pegdown].
